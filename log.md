# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, April 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a GitHub account and forked the "100-days-of-code" repo. Researched a good program for learning Python3 and decided on "Microsoft DEV236x: Introduction to Python" through edx.org. I figured this would be a good starting point since Python is brand new to me. My plan is to continue on with DEV274x after finishing this course.  

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to getting started tomorrow.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

#**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

#**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
